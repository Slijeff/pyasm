A few days ago I was working on some leetcode problems, and I was wondering how to beat 99% of the people all the time. So a strange thought came up to me, which is to find a way to use assembly in Python.
It's natural since assembly is supposed to be the "fastest" language right? Leetcode only compares your program runtime with other people who are using the same language, so this repo should work... in theroy.
